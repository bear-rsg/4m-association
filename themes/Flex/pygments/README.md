Before run `generate.py` remember to install all requirements.
This can done with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

After this you can run `./generate.py`. Remember to run inside this folder.
Because it uses relative path to place inside `static/pygments` folder.

After that, go back to the Flex path and run `gulp pygments` to generate all `min.css` files.title: (.*)
