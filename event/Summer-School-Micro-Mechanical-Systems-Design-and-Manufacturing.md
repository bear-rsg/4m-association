# Summer School on Micro Mechanical Systems Design and Manufacturing

For the 6th consecutive year, DTU is organizing the PhD Summer School on "Micro Mechanical Systems Design and Manufacturing".
<!--break-->
The Summer School is scheduled to run for two weeks at the end of June, from 25/06 to 06/07. The contents encompass an introduction to micro manufacturing technologies, design of micro components, metrology and tolerancing of micro components, as well as practical work on a project where the students apply their acquired knowledge to design and produce a prototype micro product. The course is based on strong core competencies of the Micro/Nano Manufacturing Group at MEK-DTU and features guest lecturers from the 4M Association (European association on multi-material-micro-manufacturing).  
  
The attendees will get insights on the complete micro product development from requirements and technology possibilities to manufacturing and testing, in an industrial perspective.
