## Workshop on Microfluidics for cells

<i>“Tools for tissue engineering”</i> at the Fraunhofer Institute for Reliability and Microintegration IZM, Munich branch.
<!--break-->
The use of microfluidic tools for applications in tissue engineering is a key technology. Within that field, there are various applications like cell analysis systems for bioavailability or toxicity, quick cell sorters, cell release tools, new materials for implants, bioreactors, cell injectors and many more. Microfluidic tools can help to industrialise
these technologies. A synopsis of state of the art research and industrial applications are presented at this workshop.  

In addition to the industrial viewpoint, theoretical and design topics introduce the participants of the workshop to microfluidic tools for the tissue engineering. The workshop will be rounded off by exemplifying latest research efforts. This one-day workshop at the Fraunhofer IZM is relevant for engineers, scientists as well as entrepreneurs who already utilise microfluidics for cells or plan to use them in the future and to acquire or deepen relevant knowledge in this field. Joint discussions,
also with the lecturers, serve to share experiences. Exhibits and posters support the lectures.  

The workshop fee is €290, this includes the seminar proceedings and catering.

*<b>4M Association members are offered a reduced fee of €150.</b>*
