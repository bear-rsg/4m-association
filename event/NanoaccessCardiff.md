# Nanoaccess@Cardiff

*The Annual meeting of current and potential users of Nanoscience and Nanotechnology Equipment at Cardiff (Nanoaccess@Cardiff) takes place on 6th October 2009 at Manufacturing Engineering Centre (MEC), Cardiff University.*
<!--break-->
We are pleased to invite you to the [**NanoAccess@Cardiff**](http://nanoaccess.cf.ac.uk/) user meeting on the 6th October 2009 at the [Manufacturing Engineering Centre (MEC)](http://www.mec.cf.ac.uk/), Cardiff University. This one-day event is designed to showcase the unique nano fabrication and characterisation facilities available at the MEC that are offered free of charge to UK academics under the EPSRC funded project for Free Access. This will be an excellent opportunity for current users to present the results of their research that has benefited from this EPSRC scheme during the first year of the NanoAccess@Cardiff project. 

In addition, the event will inform the UK academic community about the free access to 36 state-of-the-art micro and nano fabrication and characterisation installations available under the new FP7 [EUMINAfab programme](http://www.euminafab.eu/).

On the day the NanoAccess@Cardiff team will be on  hand to provide one-to-one consultation sessions with you, your staff and your PhD students, and thus to find out how we can help you to progress your research, and to discuss your potential applications. It is expected that this meeting will not only  inspire new users to benefit from this scheme but will also encourage current users to utilise some other nanoscience and nanotechnology equipment in their research, available either in Cardiff or offered via the EUMINA*fab* programme. 

The **provisional programme** for the NanoAccess@Cardiff annual meeting is as follows:  

**10:00** Opening and welcome: Prof. DT Pham (MEC director)
