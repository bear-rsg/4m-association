## ICOMM 2014 - 9th International Conference on Micromanufacturing

### March 26 - 28, 2014, Singapore


Many fields, including medical, aerospace, military/defense, optics, automotive, consumer products, and communications, have been increasingly demanding miniature devices and components with complex micro-scale features made from a wide selection of materials. Some current applications of miniature parts - with dimensions ranging from a few micrometers to tens of millimeters - include miniature motors and turbines, micro-satellites, implantable medical devices, minimally invasive surgery equipment, micro robots, and miniature molds and dies. It is expected that miniature parts will be increasingly demanded in the future.The 9th International Conference on MicroManufacturing (ICOMM 2014) focuses on the processes, equipment, and systems for fabricating miniature parts with micro-scale features. Papers are sought to address theoretical and applied research issues related to manufacture, assembly, and metrology for components and systems with micro-scale features. Papers are also sought that describe interesting applications of both current and emerging micromanufacturing methods and equipment, including those that bridge the nano- and macro- worlds.

All papers must be technical in nature and include original work.Â Copyrights remain with Authors.
