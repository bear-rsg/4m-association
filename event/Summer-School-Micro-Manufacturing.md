## Summer School in Micro Manufacturing

The main aim of the course is to build a new knowledge corpus applied to micro scale (most of the students already have some manufacturing or mechanical engineering basic knowledge) and develop new skills, including projects and teamwork.   
  
After the course the attendees will: 

* Get an understanding of applied product development methodologies adapted to micro technology in general and to micro mechanical products in particular  
  
* Be able to choose and apply the most relevant process chains given the requirement of micro mechanical systems  
  
* Have an understanding of supporting technologies such as metrology, handling and assembly in a micro technology context   
  
* Gain understanding of the complete product development, collaboration and integration.
