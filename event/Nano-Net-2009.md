# Nano-Net 2009

Nano-Net 2009 is the fourth edition of a successful series of event, which took place in Lausanne, Catania and Boston. The Nano-Net conference positions itself at the intersection of two worlds, namely, emerging nanotechnologies on one side, and Information & Communication Technologies on the other side.
<!--break-->
One of the standing questions that this conference addresses is: What are the new communication paradigms that derive from the transition from micro- to nano-scale devices? The convergence of nano-technologies with established and novel engineering disciplines such as communication and network theory, sensors and actuators, and bio-medical engineering is expected to radically shift our notions about efficient system and network design.

Nano-Net provides a unique multidisciplinary forum for the discussion of novel techniques in modeling, design, simulation, and fabrication of nano-scale systems.

**Venue:** Lucerne, Switzerland
