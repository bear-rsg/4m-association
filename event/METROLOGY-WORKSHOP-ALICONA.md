The workshop, organized by Dr. Manfred Prantl and his team at ALICONA IMAGING Gmbh, will be an all-day workshop including both theory and practice with hands-on training on the InfiniteFocus instrument as well as optical form and roughness measurement.  

Moreover, participants can bring their own specimens and they will have the opportunity to perform measurements on them.   

Dr. Prantl will be happy to accommodate the COTECH partners interested on the workshop but please remember that only a limited number of instruments will be available in order to allow the hands-on workshop. Make sure you book your place at the workshop as soon as possible within this week.
