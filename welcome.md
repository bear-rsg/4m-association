## Welcome to the 4M Association

Welcome to the homepage of the 4M Association, the meeting place of the micro manufacturing knowledge community. 

The 4M Association was begun by former members of the FP6 funded **[4M Network of Excellence](http://www.4m-net.org "4M Network of Excellence")** which brought together experts in the field of multi-material micro manufacture, hence "4M".

The aim of the 4M Association is to support the micro-manufacturing industry as a self-funded membership based association, acting on behalf of its members to promote their expertise and to create opportunities for commerce and research across the micro-nano manufacturing community.

The goals of the Association are to act on behalf of its members to:

* promote and represent the micro-manufacturing industry
* create opportunities for networking and interaction
* provide a focal point and knowledge resource for micro-manufacturing
* build industry contacts and to create virtual enterprises
* promote knowledge transfer, including dissemination of 4M knowledge
* provide direction and new ideas to the micro-manufacturing industry
