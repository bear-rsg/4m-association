##  First Call for Papers - Now Open 

![4M2013](/4m-association/assets/images/4m2013_logo.jpg class="thumbnail")
The First Call for Papers is published and invites papers that present original research and development in processes and process chains for multi-material micro and nano manufacture. The submission site is now open, and the deadline for submission of papers is the 27th March 2013. Further information is available, and will be regularly updated, on the [4M2013 webpages.](/4m-association/conference/2013)

## Nanoimprinting Triples Efficiency of Solar Panels

![Nanoimprinting](/4m-association/assets/images/nanoimprinting.jpg class="thumbnail")
A new method for creating solar panels using nanotechnology can double or triple their efficiency in capturing and converting light to electricity. The new nanotechnology was developed by a research group led by electrical engineering professor Stephen Chou and has the potential to significantly improve the performance of organic solar panels used to generate renewable energy.

## DTU PhD Summer School

![DTU](/4m-association/assets/images/dtu_0.jpg class="thumbnail")
For the 7th consecutive year, DTU is organising the PhD Summer School on "Micro Mechanical Systems Design and Manufacturing". The Summer School is scheduled to run for two weeks at the 17th to the 28th of June 2013. The contents encompass an introduction to micro manufacturing technologies, design of micro components, metrology and tolerancing of micro components, as well as practical work on a project were the students apply the acquired knowledge to design and produce a prototype micro product. The course is based on strong core competencies of the Micro/Nano Manufacturing Group at MEK-DTU and features guest lecturers from the 4M Association. The attendees will gain insights on the complete micro product development from requirements and technology possibilities to manufacturing and testing, in an industrial perspective.

## PaperTab: the flexible tablet PC that replaces paper?

![PaperTab](/4m-association/assets/images/papertab.jpg class="thumbnail")
Cambridge-based Plastic Logic will this week demonstrate a thin, flexible computing device that according to the company "looks and feels just like a sheet of paper". The 10.7in touchscreen devices, which currently exist only as greyscale prototypes, are designed to be used a few at a time, with different applications or windows running on each PaperTab, as opposed to running multiple applications in different windows on the same display.
