## New Book Published on Areal Surface Texture Characterisation

![AREAL](/4m-association/assets/images/arealbook.jpg class="thumbnail")
This new book has been written by several of the key players in this field, and edited by one of our invited speakers: Professor Richard Leach, and will act as a companion to the recently published areal surface texture ISO standards. The first part of the book presents characterisation methods and the second part presents case studies that highlight the use of areal methods in various subject areas.

## Tiny Chiplets: A New Level of Micro Manufacturing

![Chiplets](/4m-association/assets/images/chiplets.jpg class="thumbnail")
Using laser printers, Xerox’s Palo Alto Research Centre in California, may one day be able to create desktop manufacturing plants that use chiplets to “print” the circuitry for a wide array of electronic devices such as flexible smartphones that won’t break or smart-sensing medical bandages that could capture health data and then be thrown away.
