### Glass Microfluidic Device for High Throughput Mixing and Reactions

Dolomite, a world leader in microfluidic design and manufacture, has introduced the [1ml Microreactor Chip,](/4m-association/content/Glass-Microfluidic-Device-High-Throughput-Mixing-and-Reactions) a glass microfluidic device designed for the mixing and reacting of two or three liquid reagent streams.  

### Nanostructures in Metal Moving Liquid Uphill

[Femtosecond laser ablation](/4m-association/content/Nanostructures-Metal-Moving-Liquid-Uphill) is applied to change the surface structure of metals, such that it lifts liquid by capillary action at a speed that would make nature envious.  

### SMARTIEHS

[SMARTIEHS](/4m-association/content/SMARTIEHS) is an FP7-CP STREP which is developing a smart, high-speed, cost effective and flexible inspection system for production of Micro(Opto)ElectroMechanicalSystems (M(O)EMS).
