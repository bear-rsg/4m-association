## Integrating optical sensing into lab-on-a-chip systems

[Interesting article](/4m-association/content/Integrating-optical-sensing-lab-chip-systems) that describes how a combination of waveguides and microfluidics is easily achieved through femtosecond-laser micromachining.

## Multipurpose integrated active contact lenses

Another [article of interest to the 4M community,](/4m-association/content/Multipurpose-integrated-active-contact-lenses) predicting that electronics, sensors, and communication capabilities will all be embedded in the contact lenses of the future.
