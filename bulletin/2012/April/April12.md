![4M2011](/4m-association/assets/images/4m-2012_100.png)
The deadline for papers has passed and the submission site is now closed. The first review is underway. The first [Invited Speakers have been announced](/4m-association/content/Invited-Speakers-4M2012). The conference will be held in the modern surroundings of the new 1,200 m² [EURO PLAZA Conference Center](http://www.europlaza.at/jart/prj3/euro_pl/website.jart?rel=en&content-id=1155914559700&reserve-mode=active). An initial selection of [suggested Hotels](/4m-association/content/Hotels-Accommodation) is also now available. Further information can be found on the [4M2012 webpages](/4m-association/conference/2012) which will be regularly updated. 
  
### World's first lens-less microscope

The University of Sheffield has produced the [world's first lens-less microscope](/4m-association/content/Virtual-microscope-lens-delivers-real-revolution-imaging). With no technical limit to image accuracy or resolution, the technology is cheaper to produce than standard microscopes and is even able to `see through´ solid state devices such as microchips.  
  
### Laser source with adapted wavelength for polymer welding developed

IPG Laser GmbH, working within the frame of the European POLYBRIGHT project, have developed [a new laser source](/4m-association/content/New-laser-source-adapted-polymer-welding-developed-POLYBRIGHT-project) with an optical power of 500W that will extend the
limits of polymer welding.

  
### Diving into the world of the very small

An [ERC funded project](/4m-association/content/Diving-world-very-small) has built microscopic moving parts on to the ends of optical fibres, leading to better instruments for observing and measuring at the nanoscale.  
  
### Rapid, low-cost, point of care flu detection from a microfluidic chip

[A four-year study](/4m-association/content/Rapid-low-cost-point-care-flu-detection-microfluidic-chip) at Boston University has validated a prototype rapid, low-cost, accurate, point-of-care device that promises a better standard of care.
