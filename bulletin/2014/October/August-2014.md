October 5 – 8, 2014 | Venue: Honolulu, HI - USA
There is incredible potential in reducing the physical scale of numerous processes related to the manufacture of many forms of future dense "mechatronic" products and the manipulation of microscopic and nanoscopic objects and materials for the benefit of mankind. Small systems capable of these operations can be referred to as "microfactories.
