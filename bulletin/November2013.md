November 27-28th, 2013 | Germany

The emergence of products based on micro and nanotechnology has increased during the last two decades.  The first commercially available products of these types were based on the VLSI technology and are usually referred to as micro electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) or nano electro-mechanical systems (NEMS).  An increase in the push of products based on other materials such as metals, polymers and ceramics is significant, so many efforts are focused towards this area, usually referred to as micro/nano manufacturing.
