### ICOMM 2014 - 9th International Conference on MicroManufacturing (25-28th March 2014, Singapore)

![icomm2014](/4m-association/assets/images/icomm2014.jpg)
ICOMM 2014 focuses on the processes, equipment, and systems for fabricating miniature parts with micro-scale features. Many fields, including medical, aerospace, military/defense, optics, automotive, consumer products, and communications, have been increasingly demanding such miniature parts with complex micro-scale features made from a wide selection of materials.

### A Battery and a “Bionic” Ear: a Hint of 3D Printing’s Promise

![battery](/4m-association/assets/images/battery.jpg)
Today’s 3D printers can generally only build things out of one type of material, usually a plastic or, in certain expensive industrial versions of the machines, a metal. They can’t build objects with electronic, optical, or any kind of functions that require the integration of multiple materials. But recent advances in the research lab, including a 3D printed battery and a bionic ear suggest that this might soon change.
