### Dates

The main conference programme takes place from 13th - 15th September 2016
### Conference Theme


Papers are invited that present original research and development in processes and process chains for multi-material nano/micro/meso scale manufacture, in particular but not limited to:

  <li>Components: fabrication technologies and process chains</li>
  <li>Systems: novel product designs and assembly technologies</li>
  <li>Process modelling and simulation</li>
  <li>Process characterisation including process chains</li>
  <li>Metrology: on-line monitoring and inspection systems/methods</li>
  <li>Materials: processing and characterisation of smart materials and material related issues in micro and nano scale</li>
  <li>Micro and Nano Additive Manufacturing Technologies

In addition, contributions to the International Workshop on Microfactories (IWMF2016) on the following topics are invited:

  <li>Micro and Desktop Factory Concepts, Systems, Components and Modules
  <li>Standardization in Micro Manufacturing and Micro Factories
  <li>High Precision Production of 3D Micro-parts
  <li>Micro-assembly and Micro-handling

These topics represent the intended content of the 4M/IWMF 2016 thematic sessions, to which the
authors are invited to submit papers. 

The Conference will also feature invited special sessions focussed
on the latest technology and application advances achieved in major EC-funded and national
programmes. The follow special session has already been agreed:

  <li><strong>High throughput Integrated technologies for multi-material functional MIcro
Components</strong> (EU FP7 HINMICO project)
  

  <li><strong>Micro Technologies for Hearing-Aid Systems</strong>

  <li><strong>Micro Manufacturing of Terahertz Technology Devices</strong>
