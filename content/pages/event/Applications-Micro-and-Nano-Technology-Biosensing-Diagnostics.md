title: Applications of Micro and Nano Technology in Biosensing & Diagnostics
date: 2021-03-31

The aim of this meeting is to highlight current advances in biosensing and diagnostics being made possible by the application of micro and nanotechnology.
<!--break-->
The programme includes presentations from leading academic researchers and industrial R&D and manufacturing organisations on the use of MEMS, microfluidics, cantilever biosensor arrays, printed microstructures, MIPs, nanowires, DNA nanoswitches and paramagnetic particles. These technical presentations are balanced by an industry presentation giving a commercial perspective on the use of nanoparticles for biosensing and a view from a large diagnostics company on what it is looking for from micro and nanotechnology.
