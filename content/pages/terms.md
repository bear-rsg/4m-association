4M was established as a Network of Excellence under the European Framework Program 6 (FP6) to develop Micro- and Nano- Technology (MNT) for the batch-manufacture of micro-components and devices in a variety of materials for future microsystems products.

The aim of the Network was to act as a knowledge resource to the research community and to industry in the development of microsystems devices. Cardiff University was the co-ordinator of the Network during the lifetime of the project, now administered by C-Tech Innovation, which has taken over the role of providing further support to assist in the Networkâ€™s continued running (under the title "4M Association") beyond the period of FP6 funding. C-Tech Innovation intends to continue the running of the network and maintain links and contacts between members.
