## EUMINAfab Gender Survey

4M Members and anyone involved in MNT reserach are invited to participate in the EUMINAfab Gender Survey. The survey was developed to evaluate the situation of female scientists in the European Micro Nano Technology (MNT) community.
<!--break-->
EUMINAfab would like to get an overview of the situation of female scientists compared to male scientists in European MNT research. An important topic is the compatibility of work and family life, the battle of sexes within the work environment and other challenges of women and men. This questionnaire is intended for both men and women.

You will find the [EUMINAfab Gender Survey](http://www.euminafab.eu/index.php/about-euminafab/gender-equality) on the EUMINAfab webpages. Navigate to it by clicking on the "survey" tab.
