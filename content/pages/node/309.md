The 2009 edition of DTU/4M summerschool in “micro mechanical system design and manufacture” gathered twenty students from all over Europe (as their institution would suggest, although some were from outside Europe in terms of country of birth!).

As with the previous years, they were treated with two weeks of mainly lectures in the morning and practical work in the afternoons. The final goal had been shifted from actual production of parts to fully justified design reporting: technical drawings with tolerances (both manufacturing wise and from a functional point of view), process chain choice and description, and project management scheme. Nonetheless the students managed to be efficient enough to allow time for prototyping a micro injection moulding insert and therefore the design was tested on actual parts.

This year task was to create a device aimed at playing with capillary forces to have a race between 3 fluids with different characteristics: water, oil and alcohol.

In terms of external collaboration, guests from the CIRP Research Affiliates network and from the 4M  Network of Excellence, soon to become 4M Association, were present as lecturers and censors for the final group presentation. Industrial partners provided help and presentations as well: many thanks to <b>Esprit, Sarix</b> and <b>DesmaTec.</b>

On the social side the weather was very pleasant and the students staying in the youth-hostel seemed to have enjoyed the proximity with the woods and beaches. We also met in Copenhagen for a farewell diner in a nice Italian restaurant and later some pub hopping......
