title: Micro-drilling
date: 2021-03-31

Micro drilling is basically the same as conventional drilling. Not only the size of the tool is smaller, but the method also stands for a precise rotation and a special drilling cycle. Therefore the surface of the hole is very smooth. The revolution speed used in micro drilling is much higher than in conventional drilling.
