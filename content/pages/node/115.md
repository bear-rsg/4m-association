title: 4M Ceramics workshop at the Hannover Fair
date: 2009-05-05 

The second workshop about ceramics processing and application was held during the Hannover Fair on 21st of April 2009. The focus was put on the fabrication and processing of ceramic microcomponents using different techniques like ceramic injection molding, LTCC-fabrication and abrasive waterjet cutting technology. In the concluding discussion the costs were identified as fundamental bottleneck for the success of ceramic microcomponents. 
 
Though only attended by 10 persons, there were some really valuable contributions from the industrial (Finecut and Bosch) attendees.

This workshop followed on from the [first workshop held in Goteborg.](/node/106)
