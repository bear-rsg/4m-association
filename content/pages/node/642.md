title: International Conference on Micromanufacturing
date: 2021-03-31

Venue: University of Victoria

The 8th International Conference on MicroManufacturing (ICOMM 2013) focuses on the processes, equipment, and systems for fabricating miniature parts with micro-scale features. Papers are sought to address theoretical and applied research issues related to manufacture, assembly, and metrology for components and systems with micro-scale features. Papers are also sought that describe interesting applications of both current and emerging micromanufacturing methods and equipment, including those that bridge the nano- and macro- worlds.
