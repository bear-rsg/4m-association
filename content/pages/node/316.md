title: Management of Innovative Technologies
date: 2021-03-31

The 10th conference on Management of Innovative Technologies was organised in Fiesa, Slovenia.  The field of Technology Management is currently very broad as industry attempts to find a workable definition of "sustainability".
<!--break-->
Concepts such as "lean" management and manufacture dovetail well with sustainability, and innovative solutions are sought which can meet both the "green" agenda as well as the need for smarter working processes which drive down cost at improved quality performance.  

A Slovenian innovator presented his innovation: A hybrid vessel combined from sea kayak and sailing boat [www.viroga.com](http://www.viroga.com/showtime.htm). 
The innovator already used it to sail/paddle throughout the Adriatic sea. The participants were able to test the vessel at the end of the conference and they all agreed that it has great performance.

A keynote speaker was Prof. Kautt with paper titled Managing a European Research Infrastructure in micro and nano fabrication as an open innovation centre.  

The following contributions were presented in a
