title: Thermal evaporation

One approach to creating a thin-film coating is to create a cloud of vapor of the desired material and then present the substrate to this cloud. This can be done by heating a crucible containing the coating material. The material must be above its melting point before any useful amount of matter enters the vapor phase. Generally, such heated material sticks to and coats any cold surface. It is important to have vacuum conditions when depositing in this manner, because the atoms in the vapor should hit the wafer before being cooled by any atmosphere in the chamber. If the pressure is too high, then there are too any foreign atoms in the deposition chamber. Such conditions would have a negative influence on the purity of the deposited thin films.
