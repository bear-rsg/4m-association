This new International Conference on Manipulation,
Manufacturing and Measurement on the Nanoscale (3M-NANO), which will be held for the first time on 29 Aug - 2 Sept 2011 in Changchun, China.
<!--break-->
3M-NANO covers advanced technologies for handling on the nanoscale, including manipulation, measurement and manufacturing on the nanoscale.  
  
These technologies promise novel revolutionary products and methods in numerous fields of application.  
  
3M-NANO papers will be recommended for publication i.a. in Int. Journal of Intelligent Mechatronics and Robotics, Int. Journal of Optomechatronics and Acta Physico-Chimica Sinica.  
  
Workshops on selected topics in manipulation, manufacturing and measurement on the nanoscale will be arranged on the first day of the conference. Workshop attendance is covered by 3M-NANO registration fee.   
  
A major goal of the 3M-NANO conference is to support the development of the nanohandling research community and to encourage long-term partnerships and collaborative research activities. The social events and tours will be organized by 3M-NANO 2011 free of charge as part of this effort.
