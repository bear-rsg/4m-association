“4M2020 Workshop towards Horizon 2020 call priorities & funding for micro/nano-enabling technologies”
During the annual DTU Summer School 2015 in Copenhagen on the 24th of June, one day roadmapping workshop conducted by the 4M2020 – EU project was held. This activity is related to one of the key objective of 4M2020 – developing an overarching roadmap for the development of the required large scale demonstration and pilot plants necessary to support the introduction of new technologies in the range of market sectors. Regarding this objective, a number of roadmapping workshops were planed. Their aim is to collect and validate information from a broad spectrum of stakeholders. 
The DTU workshop was one of the planed events. The chosen application area for that workshop was “Production and manufacturing”. Within this application areas, the technologies and associated bottlenecks have been assessed. 
The main difference of DTU Summer School workshop is the ages of the attendants – young people; the participants were twelve PhD students from three different European universities. The research field of the attendants is nanotechnology. 
The results of the reported workshop will affect the final report that will be published next year.
