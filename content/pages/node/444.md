title: Summer School in Microrobotics and Self-Assembly for Hybrid MEMS
date: 2021-03-31

This Summer School is a real opportunity to go into the microworld and discover innovative approaches and tools.
<!--break-->
The general context of the summer school concerns the micromanipulation and assembly of such complex microsystems. From the state-of-the-art, integration technologies for heterogeneous microsystems are based on Microrobotics or Self-assembly approaches.  
  
Microrobotics relies on high precision robotic pick-and-place machines and machine vision. Self-assembly technology deals with high throughput parallel stochastic process. Hybrid innovative approaches actually emerge, which combine autonomy and precision of self-alignment and the flexibility of robotic technology.  
  
This Summer School addresses in particular researchers, engineers and PhD students who want to acquire or improve their skills for the micromanipulation and micro-assembly of microsystem devices.

This summer school is connected to the [FP6 Project Hydromel.](http://www.hydromel-project.eu/)


**Venue:**   *FEMTO-ST, Institute/Automatic Control and Micro-Mechatronic Systems Department(AS2M), Besan√ßon, France.*
