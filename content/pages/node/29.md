title: Concurrent micro/nano processes and materials design
date: 2021-03-31

This workshop brings together researchers and industrial experts in micro/nano structuring and material processing technologies to discuss the viability of adopting a synergetic approach in the development of materials and corresponding technologies for their processing.
<!--break-->
In particular the aim is to identify needs and ideas for material-process integration in ‘materials –> processes –>product’
chains suitable for synergetic design and development , e.g. for improving the quality and feature resolution of functional
components and replication tools for optical and micro fluidics applications, UV and thermal imprinting masters and micro injection moulding inserts.
