title: Roll laminating
date: 2021-03-31

In roll laminating, two polymer foils are bonded. Usually one of them is structured and the other one just serves to seal the microchannels. Roll laminating is a continuous process and therefore suitable for mass production. The rolls of foil are unwound during the process and pressed together. High temperature and pressure are usually necessary but variable. Optionally, chemical agents may be added. As a result the foils are bonded and the single structures can be cut out.
