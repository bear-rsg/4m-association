**MULTILAYER** is focused on the mass-production of micro devices by using several different layers which are individually structured and treated and then ultimately assembled.

This project, supported by the EC as a large-scale integrated project, brings together the facilities and experience of 19 partners from 7 European countries. The main objective of the MULTILAYER project is therefore to develop a set of solutions for the large-scale production of micro devices based on a technology we call “Rolled multi-material layered 3D shaping technology” and using the concept of tape casting and advanced printing techniques. This technology will enable the manufacture of complex multifunctional 3D-micro parts in a layer by layer manner and in a high-throughput context. Each layer can be given a specific structure. They will be printed and contain channels and cavities that are open or filled in a very high precision manner. The microsystems will have as their basic building material ceramics, which is a clear advantage in applications requiring high temperature, corrosive environments, and long time reliability (ie. cooling systems, medical applications …). As a result, cost reduction, miniaturisation and a massive integration of functions will ensure the success of the MULTILAYER platform.
