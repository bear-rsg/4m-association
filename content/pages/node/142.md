title: Chemical vapour deposition
date: 2021-03-31

Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is a chemical process used to produce high-purity, high-performance solid materials. In a typical CVD process, the substrate (e.g. a wafer) is exposed to one or more volatile precursors, which react and/or decompose on the substrate surface to produce the desired deposit. Frequently, volatile by-products are also produced, which are removed by gas flow through the reaction chamber.
Plasma-Enhanced CVD (PECVD) processes use a plasma to enhance chemical reaction rates of the precursors. PECVD processing allows deposition at lower temperatures, which is often critical in the manufacture of semiconductors.
