title: Micro-Nano-Bio Convergence Systems
date: 2021-03-31

The 4th MNBS Concertation and Consultation Workshop in Neuchatel/Switzerland is co-organized by the European Commission and CSEM. For the first time, this event will be open to external participants of the MNBS cluster:
<!--break-->
* to encourage the diffusion and exchange of information on the development of science and technology in their area  
* to identify synergies and possible collaborations  
* to recognize the future challenges and topics for R&D.  

The workshop will combine FP6 and FP7 running projects and invited presentations on relevant topics. Micro-Nano-Bio Convergence Systems is a major domain within the field of Microsystems & Smart Systems Integration, which is being supported by the European Commission under the Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) priority. The EU-funded projects in this domain focus on advanced systems by developing and integrating converging micro-nano-bio and information & communication technologies. The group currently includes MNBS for "in-vitro" testing and for in vivo interactions with the human body. In this context, invited lectures on selected topics will be presented and round table discussions will be animated.
