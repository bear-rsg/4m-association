title: 2nd Aachen Precision Days
date: 2021-03-31

This international conference with a thematic focus on precision and ultra-precision manufacturing, is addressed at participants in the field of industry and research.
<!--break-->
Organised by the Fraunhofer Institute for Production Technology (IPT) and the Center for Precision and Micro Technology (ZPM), the conference focuses
on process chains for the production of high technology components â€“ both for specialized single-item production systems and for the production of low-priced, high-end products suitable for mass production.  
  
Both new methods and opportunities for the combination of new and conventional processes will be presented at the conference. These combined process applications will play an important role in current and future research into micro-precision and are therefore one of the main topics of the conference.  
  
The technical presentations will offer an insight into new process variations as they relate to the production of technologically demanding precision and micro components. The speakers will provide an insight into the current status of technology
using examples of different production sequences involving interdisciplinary technologies that will serve as a guide for further development activities.
