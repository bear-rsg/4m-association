The previous conference was very successful from all "conferencing" aspects; great speakers, satisfied delegates who came from all over the world, and most of all the actualities of the topics. This year we would like to incorporate this previous experience and organize a conference that will once again bring together experts, researchers, experienced users, producers, and newcomers from the additive manufacturing field.
