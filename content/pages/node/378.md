Physical Vapour Deposition (<abbr title="Physical Vapour Deposition">PVD</abbr>) for micromachining of metal is mainly done by sputtering. It consists on the application of metal layers of thickness between 25 nm to 5 microns. Metals like Cu, Al, Ti, Cr, and oxides Al2O3 are the most common ones. It is used to produce diffraction gratings, pressure sensors, and micro moulds.
