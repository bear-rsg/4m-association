<strong>EUMINA*fab*</strong> is a new Research Infrastructure for emerging multimaterial micro and nano technologies. One of the EC's new I3 (Integrated Infrastructures Initiatives), EUMINA*fab* seeks to ensure that European researchers have access to high-end instruments, so they can process and characterise a multitude of functional materials as well as being able to structure and integrate different materials into complex functional devices; basically following the principle of ’converging technologies’.

This is achieved by bringing together the facilities and expertise of 10 partners who between them will make freely available in excess of 30 pieces of high-end equipment, creating a unique micro and nano technological ‘tool box’ for structuring and characterising a multitude of functional materials.
