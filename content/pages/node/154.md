title: Laser drilling
date: 2021-03-31

Laser drilling is a non-cutting machining method. The energy input by Laser is locally so high that the material ionises and evaporates. This plasma leaves the substrate and leaves a hole. The biggest advantages of this technique are the contactless machining and that the temperature stays very low.
