# AITeM Photo Contest 2018

## WCMNM2018 AITeM Photo Contest


A typical side effect when working in the micro domain is represented by some really interesting pictures of novel creations. The WCMNM2018 Photo Contest, sponsored by the AITeM Group of Interest on Micro Manufacturing Engineering, is a forum to display these pictures for recognition and evaluation by leading researchers in the field. 

The winning picture will be announced during the WCMNM2018 conference. 

## Official Rules


**Important Dates**

Final Entry Documents Due – September 15th 2018

**Eligibility and Scope**

Any researcher is eligible to participate. Both individual and group entries are welcome. An individual may participate in several entries provided each submission is on a different subject. Teams including undergraduate and graduate students are strongly encouraged and will be favoured.

The scope of what constitutes a “micro or nano-system” for the purposes of this contest is rather broad.  For this competition, photos of a “micro or nano-system” are defined as images of:
A full system or a system component(s) or surface for, but not limited to, micro mechanisms, micro- and nano-robots, micro and nano parts, microfluidics, BioMEMS/NEMS, bio-systems, and sensors and actuators at the micro and nano-scale or for sensing/actuating at the micro and nano-scale.

Contact the contest coordinator if you have any questions about whether your photo lies within the scope of this contest.
