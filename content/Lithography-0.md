## Lithography

Photolithography (also called optical lithography) is a process used in microfabrication to selectively remove parts of a thin film (or the bulk of a substrate). It uses light to transfer a geometric pattern from a photomask to a light-sensitive chemical (photoresist) on the substrate. A series of chemical treatments then engraves the exposure pattern into the material underneath the photoresist.
