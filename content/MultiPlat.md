The goal of the MultiPlat project is to develop biomimetic proton conductive membranes with nanometer thickness (nanomembranes) through convergence of the number of fields.  
  
The primary application of this multipurpose nanotechnological platform will be the next generation of fuel cells where it will replace the prevailing evolutionary modifications of the state of the art solutions.  
  
Secondary applications cover diverse fields such as photonics, sensorics, biointerfaces, medicine and others.  

The natural photon conductive nanomembranes are the most ubiquitous building element in biology. The core concept of the project is to postulate, introduce and fabricate a novel composite nanomembrane and to functionalize them through the integration of proton conducting nanochannels in a manner analogous to that in biological cells. At the same time the nanomembranes will be strengthened through the introduction of inorganic parts. This functionalization itself is a complex and largely unsolved issue. In this way the nanomembranes will merge artificial and biological properties.  
  
MultiPlat intends to use the convergence of diverse fields including physics, chemistry, biomimetics and nanotechnology. The focus will be primarily on the use of various nanotechnology methods for nanomembrane fabrication, their functionalization through lamination, surface patterning, inclusion of fillers and structural modification through the engineering of build-in nanochannels. The research should result in functional models and a breadboard model.  
  

The industrial partners will ensure the application of the results. The objectives of the project fully satisfy the call NMP-2008-1.1-1 Converging sciences and technologies (nano, bio, info, cogni).  
  
Expected impacts include breakthroughs in knowledge in the converging fields, important practical applications and industrial innovations, with major significance for clean energy production, environmental protection and welfare improvement.
