# Micro contact printing

Micro contact printing (or Î¼CP) uses the relief patterns on a PDMS stamp to form patterns of self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of inks on the surface of a substrate through conformal contact. Micro contact printing differs from other printing methods, like inkjet printing or 3D printing, in the use of self-assembly (especially, the use of SAMs) to form micro patterns and microstructures of various materials.
