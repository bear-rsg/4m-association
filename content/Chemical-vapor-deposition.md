## Chemical vapor deposition

Technology suitable small quantity production

Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is a chemical process for depositing thin films of various materials. In a typical CVD process the substrate is exposed to one or more volatile precursors, which react and/or decompose on the substrate surface to produce the desired deposit. Frequently, volatile byproducts are also produced, which are removed by gas flow through the reaction chamber.

CVD is widely used in the semiconductor industry, as part of the semiconductor device fabrication process, to deposit various films including: polycrystalline, amorphous, and epitaxial silicon, SiO2, silicon germanium, tungsten, silicon nitride, silicon oxynitride, titanium nitride, and various high-k dielectrics. The CVD process is also used to produce synthetic diamonds.

A number of forms of CVD are in wide use and are frequently referenced in the literature.

 * **Atmospheric pressure CVD** (<abbr title="Atmospheric pressure CVD">APCVD</abbr>) - CVD processes at atmospheric pressure.
 * **Atomic layer CVD** (<abbr title="Atomic layer CVD">ALCVD</abbr>) - A CVD process in which two complementary precursors (eg. Al(CH3)3 and H2O) are alternatively introduced into the reaction chamber. Typically, one of the precursors will adsorb onto the substrate surface, but cannot completely decompose without the second precursor. The precursor adsorbs until it saturates the surface and further growth cannot occur until the second precursor is introduced. Thus the film thickness is controlled by the number of precursor cycles rather than the deposition time as is the case for conventional CVD processes. In theory ALCVD allows for extremely precise control of film thickness and uniformity.
 * **Low-pressure CVD** (<abbr title="Low-pressure CVD">LPCVD</abbr>) - CVD processes at subatmospheric pressures. Reduced pressures tend to reduce unwanted gas phase reactions and improve film uniformity across the wafer. Most modern CVD process are either LPCVD or UHVCVD.
 * **Metal-organic CVD** (<abbr title="Metal-organic CVD">MOCVD</abbr>) - CVD processes based on metal-organic precursors, such as Tantalum Ethoxide, Ta(OC2H5)5, to create TaO, Tetra Dimethyl amino Titanium (or TDMAT) to create TiN. MOCVD is also called as MOMBE when it is under ultra-high vacuum.
 * **Microwave plasma-assisted CVD** (<abbr title="Microwave plasma-assisted CVD">MPCVD)
 * **Plasma-enhanced CVD** (<abbr title="Plasma-enhanced CVD">PECVD</abbr>) - CVD processes that utilize a plasma to enhance chemical reaction rates of the precursors. PECVD processing allows deposition at lower temperatures, which is often critical in the manufacture of semiconductors. See also Plasma processing.
 *  **Rapid thermal CVD** (<abbr title="Rapid thermal CVD">RTCVD</abbr>) - CVD processes that use heating lamps or other methods to rapidly heat the wafer substrate. Heating only the substrate rather than the gas or chamber walls helps reduce unwanted gas phase reactions that can lead to article formation.
 * **Remote plasma-enhanced CVD** (<abbr title="Remote plasma-enhanced CVD">RPECVD</abbr>) - Similar to PECVD except that the wafer substrate is not directly in the plasma discharge region. Removing the wafer from the plasma region allows processing temperatures down to room temperature.
 * **Ultra-high vacuum CVD** (<abbr title="Ultra-high vacuum CVD">UHVCVD</abbr>) - CVD processes at very low pressures, typically in the range of a few to a hundred millitorrs.
