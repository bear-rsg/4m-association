# Lift-off

Lift-off process in microstructuring technology is a method of creating structures (patterning) of a target material on the surface of a substrate (e.g. wafer) using a sacrificial material. It is an additive technique as opposed to more traditional subtracting techniques (like etching). An inverse pattern is first created in the sacrificial stencil layer (e.g. photoresist), deposited on the surface of the substrate. This is done by etching openings through the layer so that the target material can reach the surface of the substrate in those regions, where the final pattern is to be created. The target material is deposited over the whole area of the wafer, reaching the surface of the substrate in the etched regions and staying on the top of the sacrificial layer in the regions, where it was not previously etched. When the sacrificial layer is washed away (e.g. photoresist in a solvent), the material on the top is lifted-off and washed together with the sacrificial layer below. After the lift-off, the target material remains only in the regions where it had a direct contact with the substrate.
