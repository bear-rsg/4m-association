# Soft lithography

In technology, soft lithography refers to a family of techniques for fabricating or replicating structures using elastomeric stamps, molds, and conformable photo masks. It is called "soft" because it uses elastomeric materials most notably PDMS. Soft lithography is generally used to construct features measured on the micrometer to nanometer scale.
The steps of any of any micro- or nano- scale lithography procedures are followed by etching in order to etch a desired pattern onto a substrate. Next, the stamp is created by pouring a degassed resin overtop of the etched wafer. Common resins include PDMS and Fluorosilicone. Removing the cured resin from the substrate, a stamp contoured to the etched pattern is acquired. The stamp is then "inked" by placing it in a bath of inking solution (for example, ODT in ethanol) for a short period of time. The ink molecules then diffuse into the stamp. The inked stamp is brought in contact with the substrate for a certain length of time, allowing ink molecules to transfer onto the substrate surface. The stamp is removed, leaving the desired single-molecule thick pattern on the substrate.
