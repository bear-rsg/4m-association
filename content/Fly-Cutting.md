## Fly Cutting

Technology suitable for both serial and small quantity production

Fly cutting is basically a method for cutting grooves. When multiple grooves are cut in different directions, the remaining part can form microconvex shapes such as rectangular columns. Compared to pin making by turning, this method is advantageous in that thin products are not influenced by the machining force, because the machining force is mainly exerted on the rigid base material and not directly on the microcolumn. Fly cutting is particularly useful for producing a large number of microcolumn arrays. Micro convex shapes such as pyramids may also be fabricated.
