# 4M/ICOMM 2009 Conference papers sent to reviewers

This years conference papers have been sent for reviewer.

This year we have decided to enter all authors into a reviewer pool from which paper reviewers are drawn. Each author is assigned areas of expertise, with accordance to the themes his paper was submitted to. Since the themes are quite broad, we tried to review the automatic assignments in order to avoid obvious mis-alignment of the (reviewer,paper) tuples. We hope that this year there will be fewer occurrences of those.

The review should end March 20th
