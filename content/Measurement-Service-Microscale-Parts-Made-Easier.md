## Measurement Service for Microscale Parts Made Easier

A revolutionary microscale measurement service based on patented standing wave technology is available from InsituTec, a Charlotte, NC-based precision metrology firm.  The proprietary service provides true 3-D surface profilometry and surface finish measurement capability in one data set.

Achieving this level of precision can provide measurements on microfeatures, which represent a rapidly expanding array of products, and is one of the most acute needs in the areas of dimensional metrology. Small features in optical lenses, optical fibers and their connectors, DNA processing chips, drug delivery systems, and a myriad of other applications are increasingly common.  These components are delicate and have challenging geometries such as high aspect ratios.

The standing wave is a scanning technology with a high aspect ratio giving the ability to access deep, narrow features.  Additionally, this contact based probe has a minimal contact force (estimated to be in the order of 100nN) enabling measurement of delicate parts, with optical quality finishes.
