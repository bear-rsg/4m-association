# Laser interference lithography 

Two important breakthroughs by European researchers have brought an emerging nano-scale fabrication technology out of the lab and into the real world. The technique promises lower cost production of nano-devices at higher resolutions.

**Laser interference lithography** can produce very high-resolution nano-scale surface patterns at low cost, and now researchers working in the [DELILA](http://www.delila.cf.ac.uk/) project have made important breakthroughs in the area.   
    
Interference lithography is a surface patterning technique that has generated enormous interest in labs across the world. But the DELILA project proved the technique could work on a commercial scale.
