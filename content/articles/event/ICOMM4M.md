The [5th International Conference on MicroManufacturing](http://www.conferencing.uwex.edu/conferences/ICOMM10)
focuses on the processes, equipment, and systems for fabricating miniature parts with micro-scale features.
<!--break-->
Many fields, including medical, aerospace, military/defense, optics, automotive, consumer products, and communications, have been increasingly demanding miniature devices and components with complex micro-scale features made from a wide selection of materials. Some current applications of miniature parts - with dimensions ranging from a few micrometers to tens of millimeters - include miniature motors and turbines, micro-satellites, implantable medical devices, minimally invasive surgery equipment, micro robots, and miniature molds and dies. It is expected that miniature parts will be increasingly demanded in the future.  

**Papers are sought** to address theoretical and applied research issues related to manufacture, assembly, and metrology for components and systems with micro-scale features.

The full Call for Papers is available to download by clicking on the icon below. **Abstracts due on 30 October 2009**:
