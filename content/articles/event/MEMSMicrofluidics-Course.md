category: event

Aimed at engineers, biologists and chemists, this course will provide an introduction to MEMS and Micro-Fluidics in the context of the imminent expansion of System-on-Chip and System-in-Package technologies which enable the creation of miniature devices that integrate transducers electronic signal processing.

Participants of the course, which takes place at the **University of Lancaster, UK,** will also experience a number of hands-on experiments that demonstrate some of the basic processes that take place in a micro-fluidic device. The expected outcomes of participation on the course are the following:  

* An understanding of the technologies and assembly solutions needed for specific classes of functions.  
  
* An understanding of the underpinning engineering science associated with micro-fluidics.   
 
* An understanding of the structure of a range of sensors and actuators used in Bio-MEMS and fluidic systems.    

* The ability to use hand calculation and computer based simulation to design a range of micro structures and fluidic functions.    

* The ability to interpret material properties, and to understand the impact of these properties on system performance.
