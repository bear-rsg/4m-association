The Facility that houses the manufacturing platforms developed by the Integ-Micro project consortium will open its doors on 22nd June 2012.

Platforms developed within [Integ-Micro project](/4m-association/project/Integ-Micro) by a consortium of twenty academic and industrial partners are hybrid, reconfigurable, multitasking machines integrating different high precision techniques for the generation of 3D complex shape micro-components.  

Combining several machining technologies into one single machine allows important synergies between the different machining methods so, with these platforms, you can achieve greater accuracy, performance, have less handling and a reduced plant area.  

The innovation of the European micro-precision industry starts here.
