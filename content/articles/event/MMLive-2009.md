Following the highly successful first edition of MM Live 2008, the UK Micro Manufacturing Exhibition, the organisers have great pleasure in announcing the dates for 2009 as 20-21st October at the Ricoh Arena, Coventry, UK.

MM Live 2009 is the only UK event dedicated to Micro, Precision and Nano Manufacturing. 

More than 1000 visitors attended the debut UK micro manufacturing show in 2008 demonstrating that this exhibition has provided the industry with a much-needed platform to share its products and knowledge with micro manufacturers. Visitors attended from all over the UK and Europe, even coming from as far afield as Canada, USA, Japan and Israel. 

A particular highlight of the show was that for the first time ever in the UK, product designers and manufacturers were able to see a variety of micro manufacturing machines and technologies under one roof. These machines were seen in action producing precision micro components, giving visitors an opportunity to see live demonstrations of their wide range of capabilities.
