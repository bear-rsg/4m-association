The 14th ESAFORM conference will be held on April 27-29, 2011, hosted by QueenÂ´s University, Belfast, Northern Ireland.
<!--break-->
This conference is based on a series of mini-symposia, including a mini-symposium on
"Nano-structured materials and microforming". As in the past, one of the objectives of this mini-symposium is to get together the apparently
different topics of nano-structured materials (including ultrafine grained and nanocrystalline materials) and microforming (including sheet and bulk metal forming). The deadline for submitting an abstract is October 29, 2010.
