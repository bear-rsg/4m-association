DTU is organizing the <strong>PhD Summer School on Micro Mechanical Systems Design and Manufacturing 2019</strong>. The Summer School is scheduled to run for <strong>two weeks, from June 24th to July 5th</strong> (see enclosed flyer).

The contents encompass lecture on micro manufacturing processes and process chains as well as practical project work. Through the project the students apply the acquired knowledge to <strong>design, manufacture and test a prototype micro product</strong>. The course is based on strong core competencies of the Micro and Precision Manufacturing Group at DTU Mechanical Engineering and features guest lecturers from the 4M Association. The attendees will get insights on the complete micro product development from requirements and technology possibilities to manufacturing and testing, in an industrial perspective.
