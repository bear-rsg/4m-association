Photonics West, being held next year in San Francisco, USA, is one of the biggest laser related conferences. In the frame of Photonic West 2012 a conference entitled:  

**Laser Applications in Microelectronic and Optoelectronic Manufacturing (LAMOM) XVII**
  
is being held. The aim of this conference is to provide a forum for discussion of fundamentals, methods, and techniques in laser materials processing and their relation to the applications and manufacturing of micro- and nanoscale electronic, photonic, optical, mechanical, fluidic, energy, and hybrid devices. As in previous years, we expect to offer awards for the best student poster and student oral presentations. 

Papers are solicited on, but not limited to, the following topics within the broad area of microelectronics and optoelectronics manufacturing: 
  
* fundamental aspects of laser-surface interaction, including desorption and ablation   
* laser modification of materials (annealing, doping, intermixing, photosensitivity)  
* laser cleaning, texturing, bending and repair 
laser microscale materials processing and manufacturing  
* laser nanoscale materials processing and manufacturing, including near-field nano-optical lithography and materials processing  
* pulsed-laser deposition, laser-assisted thin-film epitaxy, atomic-layer epitaxy, resonant infrared pulsed-laser deposition, thin film and wafer processing   
* rapid prototyping and direct-write technologies including laser pattern transfer and laser-induced forward transfer   
* laser 3D fabrication   
* parallel laser manufacturing   
* laser processing from cw to fs time scales   
* laser processing across wavelength scales from VUV to IR  
* laser manufacture of MEMS and microsystems, including microfluidic chips   
* laser processing in microelectronic and optoelectronic manufacturing including laser micro processing of electronic or optoelectronic material for advanced devices and integrated systems   
* generation and dynamics of laser ablation plumes, including gas-dynamic effects, charge generation and charge transfer   
* diagnostics for laser processing and for laser produced plasmas, including real-time monitoring techniques   
* modeling of laser-materials and laser-plume interactions for quantitative prediction of process parameters   
* novel laser systems and optics for materials processing and device fabrication   
* laser-induced modification of glasses or transparent materials for applications in optoelectronic and photonics.
