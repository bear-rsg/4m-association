euspen is delighted to partner with the National Physical Laboratory UK to bring you this meeting. NPL is the UK's National Measurement Institute and a world-leading centre of excellence in developing and applying the most accurate measurement standards, science and technology available.

Structured and freeform surfaces are of growing importance for applications ranging from optics to automotive, from aerospace to bio-medical and from micro-fluidics to power generation. Whilst much of the work in this area is at the research stage, the number of products that include some form of surface structure control is growing rapidly. 

The scale of both the challenge and the opportunity provided by this area, has led us to once again bring together an internationally coordinated meeting to address this seminal topic. The third in the meeting series, supported by leading industry and research institutes alike, it will focus on the technology, needs and design of such engineered surfaces.

We are delighted to bring together leading global expertise in an open forum for focused presentations and discussions on the manufacture, measurement and function of structured and freeform surfaces.
