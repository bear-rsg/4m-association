Recent advances in modern manufacturing techniques has made it possible to manufacture small and complex components to extremely high accuracies. In direct response to the extreme demands of quality assurance for the measurement of size, form and position of microsystem parts, extensive research is being carried out in the area of geometrical measurement on the micro-scale.
<!--break-->
‘Microparts’ is a joint EURAMET research project in the area of micro co-ordinate metrology for miniature components. VSL, NPL, PTB and METAS are collaborating on the project in all aspects of micro CMM technology including the development of novel contact, optical and XCT probing techniques, machine calibration, stability, traceability and calibration artefacts. The workshop aims to disseminate the work of the project to the wider audience and discuss related research and development topics.  

Topics include:  
• Updates on the development of novel micro-CMM probes  
• Development of micro-CMM platforms  
• Calibration and traceability of micro-CMM platforms  
• Integrated micro metrology and micro manufacturing techniques
