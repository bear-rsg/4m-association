EuroNanoForum 2011 will have space for many contributed presentations and posters, enabling you to communicate your work to the whole European nanotechnology community.
Please submit your abstract now at www.euronanoforum2011.eu/calls to apply for a presentation or a poster. The deadline to submit a proposal for a presentation has been extended to Monday 7th February to enable more of you to submit. Contributions should address nanotechnology developments in areas such as:     

* ENERGY and ENVIRONMENT: nanotechnologies for water, food, solar, clean air, transport and construction  
* HEALTH: diagnostics, drug delivery and regenerative medicine  
* MANUFACTURING: nanomanufacturing, nanomaterial synthesis and applications, nanoelectronics and nanophotonics, bionanotechnology, instrumentation and metrology  
* INDUSTRIAL SAFETY: industrial safety and safety research  
* COMMERCIALISATION, including technology transfer, IP, and open innovation  
  
Submissions may address scientific, industrial and/or societal aspects:     

* Science and technology, highlighting world-class research  
* Innovation and business, identifying nanotechnology opportunities and barriers throughout the value chain  
* Society, taking a holistic approach to address societal benefits and risks.
