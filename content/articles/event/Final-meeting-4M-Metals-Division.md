The main task of this meeting will be to discuss our deliverable D7.8, the aim of which is the identification of successful cooperation strategies between research institutes whereby it should also reflect the current state  of the art regarding this issue. During the divisional meeting we will discuss the outcome of the questionnaire, which is currently  distributed amongst all 4M partners addressing their personal cooperation strategies, and to identify conclusions for the final report of this deliverable.  
We will also discuss our future collaboration post 4M: *"quo vadis" metals division?"*  

Further details will follow soon, but if you have any questions please contact [Alex Diehl](mailto:A.Diehl@lft.uni-erlangen.de).
