Venue: Suzhou, China

3M-NANO is the annual International Conference on Manipulation, Manu足facturing and Measurement on the Nanoscale, which will be held for the third time in Suzhou, China. The ultimate ambition of this new conference series is to bridge the gap between nanosciences and engineering sciences, aiming at emerging market and technology opportunities. The advanced technologies for mani足pulation, manufacturing and measu足re足ment on the nanoscale promise novel revolutionary products and methods in numerous areas of application. Scientists working in research fields related to 3M-NANO topics are invited to submit papers. All accepted full papers (presented at the conference and following IEEE format) will be included in IEEE Xplore database and indexed by Ei Compendex, upon the approval by IEEE Conference Business Services. Selected outstanding papers will be recommended for publication in the J of Micro-Bio Robotics, Int. J of Nanomanufacturing, Int. J of Intelligent Mechatronics and Robotics, the Open Mechanical Engineering J, Int. J of Optomechatronics, and other SCI/Ei journals.
