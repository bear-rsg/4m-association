Technology suitable for both serial and small quantity production

Resistance welding (together with related resistance soldering processes) utilizes an applied forging pressure and heat generated by an electric current thought the workpiece. Resistance welding combines a wide variety of techniques (spot, seam, butt, projection welding), but the most used is spot welding, in which overlapping sheets are welded by local fusion caused by current between cylindrical electrodes that clams also the components together.

Micro resistance welding is typically used in electrical and electronic industry for joining of sheet metals, e.g. for sealing of packages, wire attachment, component assembly and sheet fabrication. Resistance welding is most suitable for welding of metals with low thermal conductivity â€“ in other case a rapid toll wear can take place. Also some limitations in the joint configuration as well as certain contamination of welding zone should be taken into account when resistant welding.
