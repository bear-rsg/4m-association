### Microrobots put to the test

Robotic automation, microrobotics and robotic perception and recognition all advanced a few steps closer to their future applications during the recent [NIST Tests](/4m-association/content/Microrobots-put-tes/Microrobots-put-tes.html).   .html
### Chaos in microlasers

WÃ¼rzburg physicists have created a microlaser with unique properties. They have also succeeded in making the laser behave chaotically. In future, it may be possible to use this for a new, secure form of data transmission. [More.](/4m-association/content/Chaos-Microlaser/Chaos-Microlaser.html) 

### Laser Applications in Microelectronic and Optoelectronic Manufacturing(LAMOM)

Held in San Francisco, California, Photonics West is one of the biggest laser related conferences. In the frame of Photonic West 2012, the LAMOM conference is being held to provide a forum for discussion of fundamentals, methods, and techniques in laser materials processing and their relation to the applications and manufacturing of micro- and nanoscale electronic, photonic, optical, mechanical, fluidic, energy, and hybrid devices.
