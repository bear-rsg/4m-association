title: Ultrasonic drilling
date: 2009-05-12 

Ultrasonic drilling, also known as ultrasonic impact grinding, is a machining operation in which an abrasive slurry freely flows between the workpiece and a vibrating tool. It differs from most other machining operations because very little heat is produced. The tool never contacts the workpiece and as a result the grinding pressure is rarely more than 2 pounds, which makes this operation perfect for machining extremely hard and brittle materials, such as glass, sapphire, ruby, diamond, and ceramics.
