Although business has not grown as much as the companies had expected in the beginning of 2011, still more than half of them have been able to increase orders, production and sales during the past year. This is the finding of the [economic data survey carried out by the IVAM Microtechnology Network](http://www.ivam.de/news/euro_debt_crisis_2011_leaves_european_micro_and_nanotechnology_industry_unfazed?lang=en) in January and February 2012.
