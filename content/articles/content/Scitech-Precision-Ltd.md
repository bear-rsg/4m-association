A company which combines unique expertise in micro engineering and design to make ultra-precise parts for laser experiments has been launched.
<!--break-->
[Scitech Precision Ltd.](http://www.scitechprecision.com/), located at  STFC's Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (RAL) in Oxfordshire, is based on 30 years of experience at the laboratory, making it unique within Europe.   
  
The spin-out from the Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC) supplies complex, multi-material assemblies or "targets" for high power laser experiments on laser facilities across the world. These micron scale targets act as the "sample" for investigations into the physics of extreme conditions comparable to temperatures and pressures at the centre of the sun; they are at the forefront of research into laser-induced fusion as a potential energy source and particle beam therapies for cancer treatment.
