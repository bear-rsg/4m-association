During the first day the Partners were introduced to the [EUMINAfab Infrastructure Project](http://www.euminafab.eu/) and the possibilities it presents for the 4M community to continue to work together.

In the evening our hosts at FZK/KIT had arranged a superb meal to which we were happy to welcome Prof. Wolfgang Menz who had served our network as Chairman. To show our thanks for his service Stefan Dimov made a presentation to Wolfgang of an engraved clock.
