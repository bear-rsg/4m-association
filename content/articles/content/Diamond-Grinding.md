Micro diamond grinding has some constraints in wheel size and shape that limits achievable quality and geometry of micro parts and structured surfaces. Moreover, difficulty in grinding tool-making and preparation including truing and dressing also hampers the widespread application of diamond grinding into micro fabrication significantly. In [1], recently some innovative grinding tool concepts were proposed by Hoffmeister et al. [2] in which grinding wheels become endurable and slightly easier to make, and enhanced process stability was demonstrated with the assistance of ultrasonic vibration.
