title: Wire bonding
date: 2009-05-12  

<blockquote>
Wire bonding is the primary method of making interconnections between a microchip, such as an
integrated circuit, and a printed circuit board. Wire bonding can also be used to connect an
integrated circuit to other electronics or to connect from one printed circuit board to another.
Wire diameters start at 15 Âµm and can be up to several hundred micrometres for high-powered
applications.
There are two main classes of wire bonding:  
<ul>
<li>Ball bonding </li>
<li>Wedge bonding </li>
</ul>
In either type of wire bonding, the wire is attached at both ends using some combination of heat, 
pressure, and ultrasonic energy to make a weld.
