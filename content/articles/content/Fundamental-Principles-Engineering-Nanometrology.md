![Leach on nanometrology](/4m-association/assets/images/files/LeachBookweb.jpg) This new book is from Professor Richard Leach, a Principal Research Scientist in the Mass & Dimensional Group, Engineering Measurement Division at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL), UK. It provides a comprehensive overview of engineering metrology and how it relates to micro and nanotechnology (MNT) research and manufacturing. By combining established knowledge with the latest advances from the field, it presents a comprehensive single volume that can be used for professional reference and academic study.  
  
*Key Features*  

* Provides a basic introduction to measurement and
instruments
* Thoroughly presents numerous measurement techniques,
from static length and displacement to surface topography, mass and force
* Covers multiple optical surface measuring instruments and related topics (interferometry, triangulation, confocal, variable focus, and scattering instruments)  
* Explains, in depth, the calibration of surface topography measuring instruments (traceability; calibration of profile and areal surface texture measuring instruments; uncertainties)  
* Discusses the material in a way that is comprehensible to even those with only a limited mathematical knowledge
