![FP7](/images/FP7-gen-RGB_web_0.jpg)This is not your typical, standard Info-Day about FP7. This is an in-depth examination of the root causes of success in the funding programme. Rather than simple facts and figures, this course investigates and explains the ECâ€™s expectations, audits, evaluations, technical reviews, communication and all the hints you should know about FP7.

This two-day event, in Budapest on 3 - 4th December 2009, could be a great opportunity for you to learn more about the tricks and techniques of successful FP7 project management. You can also take the opportunity to disseminate your running projects, project ideas and create a network with potential future project partners.
