The first paper review is over. Finally all papers have been peer reviewed and the theme chairs have made their recommendations. The review went relatively smoothly, although we had to resort to quite a few rounds of reminder emails. Unfortunately everyone has to do their community service to review papers, and if not, as organisers we have no other means than to remind you early and often. At least we try not to send redundant emails to people who have completed their reviews.

Now is time to produce revised version of the accepted papers. Later there will be another round of lightweight reviews - have the paper revisions met the review.

Then come final polishing touches. Editorial work. Printing. Conference. Everyone happy, one hopes.
