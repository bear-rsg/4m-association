**PhD Research Studentship**

Development of optical coordinate metrology techniques for precision and additive manufactured components
Applications are invited from suitably qualified graduates for a fully funded PhD studentship within the Manufacturing Metrology Group. The Faculty is ranked in the top 5 out of 85 engineering departments in the UK in the last Research Assessment Exercise (RAE 2008), with most of its research output classified as world leading or internationally excellent in quality. This studentship is an excellent opportunity to become involved at the forefront of research in a rapidly developing area.

**The PhD Challenge**

The project involves the development of new optical 3D measurement systems for high-precision coordinate metrology from first principles. Special focus will be given to the ability to measure features with high slope angles and high aspect ratios, often outside the aperture range of the optics. Techniques to be considered include focus variation, interferometry and fringe projection, including hybrid designs. A number of case study components (from industrial partners) will be measured using the techniques to demonstrate their performance with different geometries, materials and surface textures.

The student will join the team of a larger project to develop new methods of measurement to be used, in many cases inline, in advanced manufacturing. Several research fellows and students will form the projects team and there is scope to apply both experimental and theoretical skills, depending on the student’s first degree topics.

**The Studentship**

The student must have a high-grade qualification; at least the equivalent of a UK 1st or 2.1 class degree in an engineering (mechanical/materials), science (physics) or a related discipline. The student must be proficient in both written and spoken English, and possess excellent presentation and communication skills.
The PhD studentship will cover full university tuition fees and a tax-free stipend at EPSRC rate of £13,863 per annum for the duration of the project for UK/EU students. The studentship is expected to start in March 2015.
