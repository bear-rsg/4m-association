##  Venue


Raleigh, the capital city of North Carolina, also known as the City of Oaks is more than a blossoming Southern metropolis- you’ll feel enriched and energized the instant you’re warmly welcomed by its smart, savvy locals, its artists create a bevy of cultural and culinary touchstones and its storytellers proudly carry on the collective heritage of a rich, historic capital city. Raleigh is also one of the fastest-growing cities in the country, part  of North Carolina's Research Triangle- one of the country's largest and most successful research parks, and a major center in the United States for high-tech research. 

The congress will be held at the <strong>The Sheraton Raleigh Hotel</strong> in Raleigh.
