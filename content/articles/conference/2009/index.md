This conference is jointly organised by the International Conference on Multi-Material Micro-Manufacture(4M) and the International Conference on Micro-Manufacture [(ICOMM)](http://manufacturing.northwestern.edu/ICOMM09/), bringing together for the first time the worldwide community of micro-manufacturing experts.  

##  Aim and Themes


The main goal of the Conference is to provide a forum for experts from industry
and academia to share the results of their in-depth investigations and engage in
interdisciplinary discussions about the creation of micro-manufacturing capabilities.

Papers are invited to present the latest advances in developing new processes
and process chains for multi-material micro manufacture and their applications
in microsystems-based products.
