### Networks of Excellence - what did they achieve?

The EC appointed an Expert Group to look at the achievements of NoEs. A particular focus is directed towards the issues of ‘critical mass’ and ‘integration’. The expert group discusses the special nature of the ‘intermediate collective research goods’ NoEs are producing as well as the structural aspect of NoEs originally supposed to form a new intra-European layer of durable virtual research organisations. Their full report can be [downloaded here.](/contents/Expert-Group-future-Networks-Excellence-Final-Report.html)
