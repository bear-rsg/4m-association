### A Battery and a “Bionic” Ear: a Hint of 3D Printing’s Promise

![battery](/images/battery.jpg)
Today’s 3D printers can generally only build things out of one type of material, usually a plastic or, in certain expensive industrial versions of the machines, a metal. They can’t build objects with electronic, optical, or any kind of functions that require the integration of multiple materials. But recent advances in the research lab, including a 3D printed battery and a bionic ear suggest that this might soon change.
