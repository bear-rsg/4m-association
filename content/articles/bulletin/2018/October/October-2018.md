Working with injection molding? Tools production? Product development? This seminar will give you the
opportunity to stay up to date with the latest developments in precision micro injection molding (μIM),
including: micro molding product development and industrial production, process monitoring and
simulation, tooling technologies, additive manufacturing, quality control, metal/ceramic/2k micro molding.

During this unique 1-day conference, the book ‘Micro Injection Molding’ will also be presented in a

Injection Molding’ book chapters as well as key-players from the micro molding industry to share their
knowledge and expertise for successful μIM.
