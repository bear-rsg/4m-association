**INDUSTRIAL WORKSHOP Higher Value production technologies and KET enabled applications**

(by Invitation only)

This project cluster workshops brings together a critical mass of industry facing R&D programmes that are strongly interrelated and aims to achieve two main objectives with this workshop:
1)      Participants to  get an insight to key technical achievements and their potential for use in different product/application contexts;
2)      Cross-fertilization of technology ideas underpinning existing and new emerging applications/products.

The format adopted for this workshop will allow more than 30 exploitable results to be presented in “innovation pitches” of 5‐minutes highlights. At the same time, during panel discussions and the coffee breaks participants will be able to interact with the presenters and other participants to discuss business opportunities and potential new joint ventures.
