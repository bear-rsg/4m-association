### 4th International Conference on Nanomanufacturing

![nanoman2014](/4m-association/images/nanoman2014.jpg)
July 8 - 10, 2014 | Venue: Bremen, Germany

Global trends towards miniaturisation have opened new fields in science and technology. The push for nanotechnology has extended the field of manufacturing so that a new discipline known as nanomanufacturing has emerged. Nanomanufacturing encompasses the synthesis of material sciences, fabrication of devices and systems, characterisation
methods and applications of nanoscience and nanotechnologies. [Read more>>](http://www.nanoman2014.net)
