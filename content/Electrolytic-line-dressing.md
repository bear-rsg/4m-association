# Electrolytic in-line dressing

Technology suitable for both serial and small quantity production

The application of this process is not properly to produce microparts, but to produce smooth and curved optical surfaces. It uses a ductile grinding machine tool with electrolytic in-line dressing (ELID). Current highly accurate ELID processing is only applicable to flat surfaces. It allows average roughness value down to 0.5 nm, and a dimensional accuracy of 1 to 1000 (typically 50 nm for a work piece of 50 mm) in the production of surfaces in hard metal. On this topic the position of Japanese and US research and industry is very advanced.
