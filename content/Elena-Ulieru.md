Elena was one of the active partners in the 4M Network of Excellence (NoE) and also a very successful author participating at every year 4M conferences with very interesting papers and contributions. 

Moreover she decided to become a regular sponsor with the company SITEX 45 SRL for some of 4M Conferences. When the 4M NoE came to end, Elena was a great supporter of the idea of setting up the 4M Association and made sure that SITEX as an organisation itself, aswell as some of its individual  members, would become the first to join.

She contributed to its operation with suggestions and advice, and  actively promoted and suggested to become a main organiser and to host a future edition of the 4M Conference in Bucharest / Romania.

After successful activities with Microelectronica Bucharest for more than twelve years as Manager of Technical Department, Innovation and IPR Patenting, Elena started with SITEX 45 SRL since 1992 as founder deeply involved into microsensors and Microsystems research and development, prototyping and microproduction. based on micro/nanotechnologies applications.

With SITEX, she contributed tremendously to the development of research and development of innovative Microsystems like MEMS/MOEMS, Elena started a wider collaborations partnership with research institutes, industry and academia, developing strategies for new and innovative nanomaterials and micro/nanotechnologies applications areas such as environment, medical and structural health monitoring chemical and biomedical RFID`s 'internet of things', and 'WSN wireless systems integration' new and renewable energy sources.

Elena initiated the research activities industrial oriented for monitoring systems development and implementation for medical, environment and ICT communications technologies. Elena played an important role as senior researcher, proposer, partner and coordinator of several R&D cooperation projects under national programs like MATNANTECH (New materials ,micro and nanotechnologies), CEEX (Research for Excellence), PNII 2007-2013 (National Program  Partnership and Innovation ) and more European FP5/FP6/FP7 projects and related programs like INCO, Marie Curie, Eurostars / Σureka, Euro-Nano-Med and Mnt-Era-Net
