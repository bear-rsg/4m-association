## World record in High-Aspect Ratio Microstructure Measurement

Working in conjunction with a major equipment manufacturer, Prof. Lars Mattsson, leader of the Metrology Division of the 4M Network of Excellence, reports that a new aspect ratio of 50:1 was recently achieved in laboratory measurements following the optimisation of an existing optical metrology system.

Prof. Mattsson, who is Chair of Industrial Metrology and Optics at KTH, Stockholm in Sweden, has benefitted from his membership of the 4M Network to visit other laboratories and audit their metrology facilities, comparing the performance of various systems using X-ray lithography manufactured artefacts made within the Networkâ€™s own Polymer Division.
