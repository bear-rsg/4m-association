# Rapid, low-cost, point of care flu detection from microfluidic chip

<!--break-->
A four-year, National Institutes of Health-funded study of 146 patients with flu-like symptoms spearheaded by Associate Professor Catherine Klapperich (BME, MSE) at Boston University has validated a prototype rapid, low-cost, accurate, point-of-care device that promises a better standard of care.  
  
Once optimized and deployed in the clinic, the new device could provide clinicians with an effective tool to quickly diagnose both seasonal and pandemic strains of influenza.
