## SMARTIEHS

SMARTIEHS is an FP7-CP STREP which is developing a smart, high-speed, cost effective and flexible inspection system for production of Micro(Opto)ElectroMechanicalSystems (M(O)EMS).
<!--break-->
SMARTIEHS decreases the inspection time of a wafer by a factor of 100. It cuts production costs and shortens the time-to-market. To achieve this, SMARTIEHS develops an innovative measurement concept:   
 
* A probing wafer consisting of an array of micro optical sensors is adapted to, and aligned with, the wafer under test.  
* The design and production of the micro-optical interferometer array inspects 100 M(O)EMS structures within only one measurement cycle.  
* A multifunctional approach of the measurement concept allows the inspection of passive and active parameters within one inspection system.  
* A novel smart pixel detector array is developed.  

SMARTIEHS provides a multifunctional design with two interferometer configurations; a low coherent interferometer and a laser interferometer. The project focuses on the measurement of shape and deformation, resonance frequency and vibration amplitude distribution.
