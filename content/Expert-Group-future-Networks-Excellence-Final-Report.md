# Expert Group on the future of Networks of Excellence - Final Report

In this Final Report, achievements of NoEs are reviewed without aspiring to perform a full and detailed assessment of individual NoEs. A particular focus is directed towards the issues of ‘critical mass’ and ‘integration’.

The expert group discusses the special nature of the ‘intermediate collective research goods’ NoEs are producing as well as the structural aspect of NoEs originally supposed to form a new intra-European layer of durable virtual research organisations. In that context, the group also considers the roles of NoEs for national research institutions, such as universities and research organisations.

In the expert group’s view, the objectives of the NoE scheme were ambiguous and the scheme was successful to a limited extent only regarding the general objective of developing
integrated and sustainable ‘virtual centres of excellence’. However, the NoE ‘experiment’ is seen as valuable and important because it showed that in such organisational setting valuable collective goods can be produced that would not result from other arrangements. Some NoEs have even come close to achieving the originally defined objectives.

Therefore, based on the review of the FP6 NoE scheme, the expert group proposes renewed funding opportunities for a very limited number of NoEs that are successfully moving
towards achieving the objectives of the NoE scheme. Furthermore the Commission is invited to consider appropriate existing funding schemes for supporting valuable activities developed by other NoEs.

Based on the review of the serious problems both in the conceptual phase and – as a consequence – also during implementation the expert group recommends to discontinue the
NoE scheme.

For the future, a revised concept is proposed: ‘Joint Research Initiatives (JRIs)’ oriented towards long-term (academic) research of ‘slender’ alliances between universities and research organisations. The objective of Joint Research Initiatives should be the creation of ‘virtual institutes’ of a manageable size of about 3 to 7 partners. The science-led JRIs are seen as potential ERA instruments complementary to the industry-led Joint Technology Initiatives (JTIs). In addition, they are proposed to become the institutional complement to the individual researchers funded through the ‘Ideas’ specific programme and the European Research Council.

Furthermore, the expert group recommends that the Commission develops the JRI concept in close interaction and consultation with stakeholders at member states level and from universities and research organisations. In addition, the Commission is invited to organise an internal process in the Commission services utilizing the experience from the implementation of FP6 NoE scheme and ensuring a coherent understanding of the new JRI scheme.

Finally, the expert group sees the necessity that the development of the ERA instruments is closely followed and monitored. In the ERA Green Paper ambitious goals are proposed that have been further developed during the follow up consultations and in the recent Communications by the Commission. The expert group is convinced that these goals will be difficult to reach without the provisions of appropriate intermediate collective research goods.

The concept of ‘Joint Research Initiative’ is proposed to serve that purpose.
