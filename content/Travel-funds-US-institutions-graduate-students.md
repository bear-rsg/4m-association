# Travel funds for U.S. institutions' graduate students 

The National Science Foundation (NSF) is providing travel funds for graduate students studying in U.S. institutions to participate in the 4M/ICOMM 2015 International Conference on Micromanufacturing. The provided partial support will cover ~ 50-70% of travel, registration, and lodging expense incurred for attendance of the 4M/ICOMM 2015. However, to compete for the travel funds the graduate student must be an author or co-author of a paper accepted for the 4M/ICOMM 2015. Selection will be on a competitive basis, limited by the available funds. 

 


**Motivation:**

It is important to train our next generation of engineers and researchers with a global perspective, these graduate student travel funds will provide the selected graduate students with opportunities to exchange ideas with leading researchers and engineers from worldwide academe, industrial and governmental facilities, as well as the opportunity to visit with experts from companies involved with micromanufacturing in Europe. An opportunity for exchange, the 2015 International Institute for Micromanufacturing (I2M2) and the 4M Association will be convening together the worldwide community of micromanufacturing experts. The venue for this gathering will be the co-location of I2M2 and 4M Association annual conferences into a premiere global conference on micromanufacturing expected to draw attendance from America, Europe and Asia. The 4M/ICOMM serves as an excellent platform for exchange of ideas in the field of micromanufacturing and micro-engineering.
