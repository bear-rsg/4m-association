<strong>FlexPAET</strong> will address limitations of state-of-the-art micro machining technologies and optical design calculation methods with respect to the production of optically functionalised elements on large surfaces.

An advanced process chain will be developed for the flexible, self-optimising fabrication of highly complex, large-area micro structured surfaces. In this process chain optically fully functional master structures will be manufactured directly into thermoplastic substrates by means of step and repeat methods. A specifically developed advanced step embossing process prints a structural pattern into the substrate. Utilising in-situ metrology, the optical performance of this master substrate will be analysed, compared to the design requirements, and an optimisation algorithm will determine necessary rework on the substrate. Rework iterations will be repeated until the performance of the master substrate matches the design specifications, thus constituting an adaptive, fully self optimising production process. The final, completely functional master substrate will then be used to produce a mould in order to replicate the structure. Galvanic processes will be optimised for the specific requirements of micro structure forming including large-area substrate sizes. Finally, these moulds will be used in replication processes such as injection moulding, injection embossing, allowing for high-volume production of optically functionalised elements. Furthermore, and beyond the scope of optically functionalised elements production, by bridging the gap between conventional micro manufacturing technologies and cost-effective high volume production, Flexible Patterning Technology will provide a means for utilising advanced micro technology in consumer products and applications. Due to the holistic research approach which integrates mould making and mass replication, the proposed technology is extending the range of micro fabrication process capabilities to encompass a wider range of materials and geometric forms in order to produce a new generation of innovative, high value added products.
