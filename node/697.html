<h3>At HSG-IMAT a new programme called 3W-MID was set up for the rapid production of MID devices</h3>
<p><img alt="HSG-IMAT" src="/images/hsgimat_0.jpg">
In order to make reliable statements on applicability and reliability of MID, real MID based on injection molded components are required. With the program 3W-MID, HSG-IMAT offers its competencies in MID production for a fast and cost efficient access to this technology. Starting from a MID suitable design, first prototypes employing real materials and processes can be on hand within 3 weeks. <a href="http://www.imat.hsg-imit.de/fileadmin/hsg-imat/Downlaod/3W-MID_Flyer_e.pdf">Read more&gt;&gt;</a> </p>
<h3>14th International Conference of the European Society for Precision Engineering and Nanotechnology</h3>

June 2 - 6, 2014 | Venue: Dubrovnik, Croatia</p>
<p>The European Commission has identified a number of key enabling technologies as being main drivers for developing the European industry sectors until year 2020. These include Micro- and nano-electronics, Photonics, Nanotechnologies, Advanced materials, Biotechnology and Advanced manufacturing and processing. <a href="http://www.euspen.eu/OurEvents/Dubrovnik2014.aspx">Read more&gt;&gt;</a> </p>
<h3>DTU PhD Summer School -</h3>
<p><img alt="dtusummer" src="/images/dtusummer.jpg">
June 16 - 27, 2014 | Venue: Technical University of Denmark</p>
<p>For the 8th consecutive year, DTU is organising the PhD Summer School on "Micro Mechanical Systems Design and Manufacturing". The Summer School, supported by 4M is scheduled to run for two weeks at the end of June, from 16/06 to 27/06. 4M are offering six sponsored places for PhD students. The contents encompass an introduction to micro manufacturing technologies, design of micro components, metrology and tolerancing of micro components, as well as practical work on a project were the students apply the acquired knowledge to design and produce a prototype micro product. <a href="http://http://www.conferencemanager.dk/mppsummerschool2014/overviev.html">Read more&gt;&gt;</a> </p>
<h3>4th International Conference on Nanomanufacturing</h3>
<p><img alt="nanoman2014" src="/images/nanoman2014.jpg">
July 8 - 10, 2014 | Venue: Bremen, Germany</p>
<p>Global trends towards miniaturisation have opened new fields in science and technology. The push for nanotechnology has extended the field of manufacturing so that a new discipline known as nanomanufacturing has emerged. Nanomanufacturing encompasses the synthesis of material sciences, fabrication of devices and systems, characterisation
methods and applications of nanoscience and nanotechnologies. <a href="http://www.nanoman2014.net">Read more&gt;&gt;</a> </p>
