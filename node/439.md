## Summer School in micro mechanical system design & manufacture

Micromechanical components play an increasing role in micro systems. The use of metals, polymers and ceramics for miniature components requires new product development methods as well as manufacturing technologies, where product dimensions may range from micrometre to millimetre.
<!--break-->
This Summer School is situated in the context of such emerging micro/nano technologies. Attendees will get insights on the complete product development cycle from requirements and technology possibilities to manufacturing and testing, in an industrial context. Further details on the [Summer School website.](https://conferences.dtu.dk/conferenceDisplay.py?confId=45)  
  
There is a limited number of **bursaries available to 4M Association members.**
