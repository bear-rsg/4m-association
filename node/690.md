## Applications of super-resolution imaging in the field of surface topography measurement

![topography](/4m-association/assets/images/topography.jpg)
A large range of high-value manufactured parts require structures to be produced over large areas (metres squared) at high-resolution (micrometres and smaller). Such manufacturing puts demands on the metrology that is required to assure product quality. High-speed, in-line metrology solutions are required to operate over large ranges with high-resolution. In this review, the use of optical super-resolution techniques to enhance the dynamic range of surface topography measuring instruments to allow them to be used in high dynamic range manufacturing scenarios will be highlighted.

## FoodMicroSystems roadmaps now published!

![foodmicro](/4m-association/assets/images/foodmicro.jpg)The Four reports are available: three roadmaps for the implementation of microsystems in the dairy, meat and beverage sectors and one final report. This final report provides suggestions to address the technological needs in three areas: chemical and biochemical electronic sensors, microorganism detection and tracking and tracing systems. enablingMNT has coordinated the roadmapping work package. To download the reports, click [here](http://www.foodmicrosystems.eu/?page_id=1159).

## 4th International Conference on Nanomanufacturing

![nanoman2014](/4m-association/assets/images/nanoman2014.jpg)
July 8 - 10, 2014 | Venue: Bremen, Germany

Global trends towards miniaturisation have opened new fields in science and technology. The push for nanotechnology has extended the field of manufacturing so that a new discipline known as nanomanufacturing has emerged. Nanomanufacturing encompasses the synthesis of material sciences, fabrication of devices and systems, characterisation
methods and applications of nanoscience and nanotechnologies. [Read more>>](http://www.nanoman2014.net)

## 9th International Workshop on Microfactories - Call for Papers

![iwmf2014](/4m-association/assets/images/iwmf2014.jpg)
October 5 – 8, 2014 | Venue: Honolulu, HI - USA

There is incredible potential in reducing the physical scale of numerous processes related to the manufacture of many forms of future dense "mechatronic" products and the manipulation of microscopic and nanoscopic objects and materials for the benefit of mankind. Small systems capable of these operations can be referred to as "microfactories." [Read more>>](http://iwmf2014.northwestern.edu/)

## 4M Member SITEX Publishes Project Partner Success Story

![sensglass](/4m-association/assets/images/sensglass.jpg)
SENSGLASS: Innovative Optical Micro sensors based on Rare-Earth-Doped Ph -  The general objective of this project is the development of an innovative sensor to be used in measuring of 1D and 2D angular displacement, based on the previous outcomes of R&D activities performed by consortium members. The essential constituent of the intended non-contact speckle laser sensor is a rare-earth-doped phosphate glass (REPG) part. A novel method for measurement of a singular 1D and 2D displacement for arbitrarily shaped
objects will be developed along with the device. [Read more>>](http://www.mnt-era.net/mnt-era-net-success-stories/SENSGLASS%20%282010%29)
