## Use microwaterjetting for a medical part 

<!--break-->
A group of US researchers needed to machine a magnetic pole structure with a thickness of 100μm to 150μm from Hiperco 50 sheet, an iron-cobalt-vanadium soft magnetic alloy that exhibits high magnetic saturation.   
  
They tried several cutting methods with limited success, but were pleased to discover that [waterjetting](/4m-association/content/Water-jet-WJ-and-sinking-electrical-discharge-machining-.md) was the best solution to their challenge. While a conventional waterjet could not cut the part, new microwaterjet technology could.
