## Per Johander

<!--break-->
![Per Johander](/4m-association/assets/images/Per_obit.jpg)It is with great sadness that we have to inform you of the passing of our friend and colleague Per Johander.  
  
Per was one of the original partners in the 4M Network of Excellence (NoE) and was joint leader of the Ceramics Processing Division. Always full of energy and ideas he was instrumental in the success of the ceramics group, their work culminating in the publication of a handbook on [Ceramics Processing in Microtechnology ]( /4m-association/content/Ceramics-Processing-Microtechnology).  
  
When the 4M NoE came to an end, Per was a great supporter of the idea of setting up the 4M Association and made sure that Swerea IVF was one of the first to join.  He contributed to its operation with suggestions and advice, and was always willing to Chair a session at the annual 4M Conference. Anyone who shared a meal with him will also know he was great company.  

Per Johander joined Swerea IVF in 1990 to work with electronic packaging and electronic reliability. He contributed tremendously to the development of research at IVF with innovative ideas, starting collaborations, developing strategies for new areas and mentoring young researchers.  
  
Per initiated the work on dye sensitized solar cells at Swerea IVF. Though he left the research on solar cells, he never lost his passion for this technology. He developed the work at Swerea IVF on electronic packaging for high temperature and severe environments. Per Johander played an important role as initiator and researcher in several EU projects.  
  
Per got his Ph.D. in Physical Chemistry 1986 at Göteborg University. His early research work was on photo electrochemistry.  He did his post doc in Japan with Prof. Kohei Uosaki at Hokkaido University and became an Associate Professor in 1998 at Environmental Science, Göteborg University
  
Per, who had suffered ill health in recent years, passed away on Wednesday night, 12th December 2012.  
  
The 4M Association sends its deepest condolences to Per's family, friends and colleagues.
