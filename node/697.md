## 4M Announcement - Call for Projects: 4M2020 Foresight Forum

![4M2020 Logo](/4m-association/assets/images/newsletter4mlogo.jpg class="thumbnail")
The 4M2020 programme (*) is organising a Foresight Forum from the 9th to 11th September 2014 in Grenoble (F) to review the research needs in Micro and Nano Manufacturing and inform H2020 about future priorities in this field. A number of projects that are currently funded by the Commission have already been identified and invited to attend, but we would also like to offer the opportunity for the 4M Association community to propose other projects to attend the forum.

## At HSG-IMAT a new programme called 3W-MID was set up for the rapid production of MID devices

![HSG-IMAT](/4m-association/assets/images/hsgimat_0.jpg class="thumbnail")
In order to make reliable statements on applicability and reliability of MID, real MID based on injection molded components are required. With the program 3W-MID, HSG-IMAT offers its competencies in MID production for a fast and cost efficient access to this technology. Starting from a MID suitable design, first prototypes employing real materials and processes can be on hand within 3 weeks.

## DTU PhD Summer School - 

![dtusummer](/4m-association/assets/images/dtusummer.jpg class="thumbnail")
June 16 - 27, 2014 | Venue: Technical University of Denmark

For the 8th consecutive year, DTU is organising the PhD Summer School on "Micro Mechanical Systems Design and Manufacturing". The Summer School, supported by 4M is scheduled to run for two weeks at the end of June, from 16/06 to 27/06. 4M are offering six sponsored places for PhD students. The contents encompass an introduction to micro manufacturing technologies, design of micro components, metrology and tolerancing of micro components, as well as practical work on a project were the students apply the acquired knowledge to design and produce a prototype micro product.

## 4th International Conference on Nanomanufacturing

![nanoman2014](/4m-association/assets/images/nanoman2014.jpg class="thumbnail")
July 8 - 10, 2014 | Venue: Bremen, Germany

Global trends towards miniaturisation have opened new fields in science and technology. The push for nanotechnology has extended the field of manufacturing so that a new discipline known as nanomanufacturing has emerged. Nanomanufacturing encompasses the synthesis of material sciences, fabrication of devices and systems, characterisation
methods and applications of nanoscience and nanotechnologies. [Read more>>](http://www.nanoman2014.net)
