## 2nd International Symposium on Flexible Organic Electronics 

**Venue:**  
Porto Carras Hotel in Halkidiki, Greece.  

**Deadline for Abstract Submission for Oral or Poster presentation**  
31 March 2009.  

The purpose of the Symposium is to bring together scientists and engineers actively engaged in the research, development, and manufacturing for Flexible Organic Electronics including  organic/inorganic materials, flexible substrates, manufacturing processes, circuit designs, flexible devices, system integrations and product applications, and to discuss current progresses in this emerging field.

The IS-FOE will cover the most advanced topics and subjects in the areas of:  
● Organic electronic materials (small molecule and polymers)  
● Organic/inorganic and hybrid materials and systems  
● Flexible substrates & encapsulation methods & materials  
● Molecular electronics and photonics  
● Self organized molecules and systems  
● Theory & modelling (materials, components and devices)  
● Manufacturing processes (printing, vacuum, chemical)  
● Flexible displays & lighting  
● Flexible solar cells  
● Flexible circuits and sensors  
● Flexible batteries
