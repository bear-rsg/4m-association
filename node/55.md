## Scanplast, Konstruktion och Design, and Electronix

A joint workshop between 4M Ceramic and Sensor & Actuators divisions will be held in Goteborg the 11th of March.  This event is three fairs in one and the topics are Polymers (Scanplast), Design (Konstruktion och Design) and Electronics (Electronix).

**VENUE:**  Svenska Mässan, Göteborg, Room R4  

**REGISTRATION:** This workshop is free but pre-registration is required for free lunch. To pre-register please contact: <a href="mailto:Agneta.Andre@swerea.se">**Agneta André.**</a>

The workshop will give an overview on the product development process of ceramic micro parts related to Sensors & Actuators applications with focus on Applications, Manufacturing and Reliability.

The workshop will:
 
* Identify the critical steps and missing competence
* Define 4M services and identify industrial service providers
* Collect the resources and structure them in the production process.
