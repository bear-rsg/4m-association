## wet chemical etching

Etching is used to chemically remove layers from the surface of a wafer during manufacturing. 
For many etch steps, part of the wafer is protected from the etchant by a "masking" material which resists etching. In some cases, the masking material is photoresist which has been patterned using photolithography. Other situations require a more durable mask, such as silicon nitride.
The wafer can be immersed in a bath of etchant, which must be agitated to achieve good process control. 
Different specialised etchants can be used to characterise the surface etched.
Some wet etchants etch crystalline materials at very different rates depending upon which crystal face is exposed. In single-crystal materials, this effect can allow very high anisotropy.
