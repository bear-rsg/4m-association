## Adhesive bonding

> Adhesive Bonding is a modern joining process in which a liquid or semi liquid substance is applied 
> to adjoining work pieces to provide a long lasting bond. This process is highly useful in bonding
> dis-similar materials that can not be welded. Materials that have the ability to be bonded
> together are virtually unlimited. Adhesives used in bonding can exist in many forms and be made
> from various natural and/or artificial compounds. A hindrance to this process is that adhesive
> bonds are not instantaneous such as welding or nailing. Adhesive bonds take more time to process,
> in order to allow the adhesives to cure.
