<p>Moreover she decided to become a regular sponsor with the company SITEX 45 SRL for some of 4M Conferences. When the 4M NoE came to end, Elena was a great supporter of the idea of setting up the 4M Association and made sure that SITEX as an organisation itself, aswell as some of its individual  members, would become the first to join.</p>

<p>After successful activities with Microelectronica Bucharest for more than twelve years as Manager of Technical Department, Innovation and IPR Patenting, Elena started with SITEX 45 SRL since 1992 as founder deeply involved into microsensors and Microsystems research and development, prototyping and microproduction. based on micro/nanotechnologies applications.</p>
<p>With SITEX, she contributed tremendously to the development of research and development of innovative Microsystems like MEMS/MOEMS, Elena started a wider collaborations partnership with research institutes, industry and academia, developing strategies for new and innovative nanomaterials and micro/nanotechnologies applications areas such as environment, medical and structural health monitoring chemical and biomedical RFID`s 'internet of things', and 'WSN wireless systems integration' new and renewable energy sources.</p>
<p>Elena initiated the research activities industrial oriented for monitoring systems development and implementation for medical, environment and ICT communications technologies. Elena played an important role as senior researcher, proposer, partner and coordinator of several R&amp;D cooperation projects under national programs like MATNANTECH (New materials ,micro and nanotechnologies), CEEX (Research for Excellence), PNII 2007-2013 (National Program  Partnership and Innovation ) and more European FP5/FP6/FP7 projects and related programs like INCO, Marie Curie, Eurostars / Σureka, Euro-Nano-Med and Mnt-Era-Net</p>
<p>Elena was awarded an MSc. in Industrial Technologies 1978 at Bucharest University.and MBA in International  Cooperation,1986 at Bucharest Economical Sciences Academy</p>
<p>Elena suffered cardiac illness which started in 2006, however then successfully overpassed a complex and complicated intervention for two heart mechanical valve implantations at Herzzentrum Mediclin Lahr Germany on February 2007, but she continued very actively with great efforts and sacrifice for the company SITEX profile permanent development with innovative products, implementation and new areas of operations.</p>
<p>In honour of Elenas memory, SITEX corporate management in cooperation with 4M Association will offer a prize for best paper issued by young female scientist entitled “ Elena Ulieru- Innovation Award" endowed with 3,000 Euros, at annual 4M conferences, starting for the first time with the 4M Conference 2013. The selection procedure will also be in accordance with conference topics looking for future-oriented ideas for innovative micromanufacturing of sensors, microsystems and measuring technology with clearly discernible market relevance. </p>
<p>Conditions of participation, forms, and further selection information will be found on the site of 4M Association Conference 2013  together with the conference information package.</p>
