(FP7 People -Marie Curie Action -STEEP Project)
The job offer is focused on the development of a laser machining (LM) path simulator, implementation and demonstration, considering different laser sources and materials. This Beam Path Simulator (BPS) will be validated in industrial environment. The candidate will coordinate and optimize the models previously developed by different ESRs during the first stage of the STEEP project. Based on this results and on the previous expertise developed at IK4 – TEKNIKER in terms of laser machining, the project aims to understand and model accurately and efficiently how surface condition, material peculiarities, laser characteristics and processing parameters affect the footprint in laser machining - [Read More](http://ec.europa.eu/euraxess/index.cfm/jobs/jobDetails/33967154)
