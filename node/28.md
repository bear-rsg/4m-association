## Multi-Material Micro-Manufacture of RF Components

The aim of this workshop is to identify industrially perceived needs for the manufacture of a range of functional devices that incorporate microwave elements.
<!--break-->
By the means of a series of introductions and case-book examples, this sandpit aims to identify product exploitation gaps which recent technology advances can help to fill. The fabrication of microwave components using fabrication technologies available within the 4M network will be explored.
