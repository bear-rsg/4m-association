## EUSPEN 2010

<!--break-->
![euspen](/4m-association/assets/images/euspen.png)Rapid and efficient industrial innovation requires not only leading scientific knowledge, but an understanding of latest technological advances and the harnessing of effective collaboration. Euspen  provides an entrepreneurial network of leading industrialists and researchers working in the field of precision, micro and nano engineering through which these three key activities are delivered.
 
Technologically, euspen’s focus lies in:

* Nano-precision manufacturing  
* Design and build of ultra-precision machine systems  
* Characterisation: metrology systems, instruments and techniques  

Special interest groups also address particular emerging challenges to industry such as: structured and free form surfaces; thermal effects in precision systems and the implementation of microfabrication technologies into SMEs.
 
[euspen’s 10th International Conference](http://delft2010.euspen.eu/page1099/Conference/Home)  which takes place in Delft, Netherlands, will once again provide a leading forum in which to communicate and survey the latest research, technology and product developments within the community.
