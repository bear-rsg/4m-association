## Ultra-Precision Positioning Systems - piezo drive systems as a future enabling technology 

Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, 3001 Leuven, Belgium

In light of the ever increasing industry-driven demand for accurate positioning, this symposium discusses the state of the art of precise positioning systems, with a focus on recent developments and applications of piezoelectric driving technology. Piezoelectric positioning systems are gaining maturity, and have gradually evolved into interesting - but sometimes unknown - alternatives to conventionally driven systems in a multitude of automation, biomedical, manufacturing and metrological applications.

The symposium will bring the attendant up to speed with the principles, applications and market opportunities of piezoelectric driving technology.
