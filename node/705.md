![4M/ICOMM 2015 ](/4m-association/assets/images/4m-conf-2015_0.jpg class="thumbnail")
Papers are invited that present original research and development in processes and process chains for multi-material nano/micro/meso scale manufacture, in particular but not limited to:
•    Components: fabrication technologies and process chains
•    Systems: novel product designs and assembly technologies
•    Process modelling and simulation
•    Process characterisation including process chains
•    Metrology: on-line monitoring and inspection systems/methods
•    Materials: processing and characterisation of smart materials and material related issues in micro and nano scale

## 4M Announcement - 4M2020 Foresight Forum

![4M2020 Logo](/4m-association/assets/images/newsletter4mlogo.jpg class="thumbnail")
The 4M2020 programme is organising a Foresight Forum from the 9th to 11th September 2014 in Grenoble (F) to review the research needs in Micro and Nano Manufacturing and inform H2020 about future priorities in this field.  This is an invitation only event, and we would be very grateful if you could indicate your intention to attend by replying to David Gardner and Brigitte Rameau by the end of June.


## 9th International Workshop on Microfactories

![4M2020 Logo](/4m-association/assets/images/iwmf-2014.jpg class="thumbnail")
October 5 – 8, 2014 | Venue: Honolulu, HI - USA
There is incredible potential in reducing the physical scale of numerous processes related to the manufacture of many forms of future dense "mechatronic" products and the manipulation of microscopic and nanoscopic objects and materials for the benefit of mankind. Small systems capable of these operations can be referred to as "microfactories. [Read more>>](http://iwmf2014.northwestern.edu/)


## New Book Published - Richard Leach - Fundamental Principles of Engineering Nanometrology (Micro & Nano Technologies)

![4M2020 Logo](/4m-association/assets/images/book.jpg class="thumbnail")
This book is an essential guide for the emerging nanomanufacturing and nanofabrication sectors, where measurement and standardisation requirements are paramount both in product specification and quality assurance. Updated to cover new and emerging technologies, and recent developments in standards and regulatory frameworks, this second edition includes many new sections.

## LET’S 2014 will be held in Bologna (Italy) from September 29th to October 1st 2014

![4M2020 Logo](/4m-association/assets/images/lets-2014.jpg class="thumbnail")
LET’S 2014 will focus on the perspective of Nanotechnologies, Advanced Materials, Advanced Manufacturing, Processing and Biotechnology and will point out how the industrial system should be able to develop the industry’s ability to integrate - through a systemic approach - creativity, culture, knowledge and competitiveness.
