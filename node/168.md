## Direct bonding

The substrates are first exposed to a chemical treatment, for example with a mixture of hydrogen peroxide and sulphuric acid. This makes them hydrophilic what is essential for the bonding. By a high contact force, two substrates (e.g two silicon wafers) are compressed. The materials get so close, that molecular adhesive forces begin to act. The material then is annealed at high temperature so that the direct bonding is strong enough to keep the substrates together.
